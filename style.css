Styling the Carousel

1) Set a max-width of 600px & position relative on the div 'carousel'
2) Hide all 'carousel-item' divs
3) Make sure all images inside 'carousel-item' have a max-width that matches the main 
'carousel' div
4) All images within 'carousel-item' must be responsive, so think about setting a 
max-width on the images and how you'd make the image 100% width of 'carousel-item' 
5) We want the first 'carousel-item' to be visible, think about the class we added to the first item. Make sure that class is always shown
6) The 'carousel-actions' needs to be on top of the slider, so think about positioning 
and how you can use relative/absolute positioning to put the 'carousel-actions' on top of 
the slider
7) Make some beautiful buttons!
8) Space those buttons from the left & right - we want to make sure they're not touching 
the edges of the slides, but adequately spaced



    Hiding non-active slides
    
    1) In our 'styles.css', add a new class 'carousel-item-hidden' that is set to display none
    2) Create a new function called 'hideAllSlides'
    3) Inside 'hideAllSlides' use a 'for of loop' to iterate through the slides (each iteration will give you direct access to 'carousel-item')
    4) When inside the 'for of loop', remove the class 'carousel-item-visible' and add the class 'carousel-item-hidden' - all our slides will now be hidden, and inside 'moveToNextSlide' at the end, we add back the slide we want visible!
    5) Call 'hideAllSlides' right away within the function 'moveToNextSlide' - make sure it's before any other code!
